# requirement-analysis
This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **Requirement Analysis** in the software development lifecycle.
The purpose is to document the importance, process, and techniques of gathering and analyzing requirements before implementation.
By breaking down both functional and non-functional requirements, this repository serves as a reference for understanding how well-defined requirements ensure successful project outcomes.
